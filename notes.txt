Different modes:
- Letter editor
- Language editor
- Writing

To-Do:
- Write menu
    - Loading texts
- Excluding Groups in open
    - Saving these settings per session
Setting fill and outline of multiple letters in write

Bugs:
When pressing new in write, there is an error about not being able to delete an item in the treeview. Part of the code stops working after that.

Open windows don't close when loading a new letter, they can't be closed afterwards

There is sometimes a mismatch between relative position and global position

The group button only works when having saved (why?)

Deleting a group doesn't set saved to false

saving in write doesn't put save to true
