Different modes:
- Letter editor
- Language editor
- Writing

To-Do:
- Write menu
    - You can choose background color (Color Picker?)
    - Set stroke size, size, fill color (custom or background color)
    - Setting width and height
    - Loading positioning and templates (with a chosen size, show a preview)
    - Fill function for a segment -> Creates a polygon, maybe rewrite draw functions?
- Export
    - Chose Name, export png

Bugs:
- Weird behaviour when deleting in write -> Not responding?
- Children in write sometimes move incorrectly
