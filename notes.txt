Different modes:
- Letter editor
- Language editor
- Writing

To-Do:
- Write menu
    - Loading texts
- Excluding Groups in open
    - Saving these settings per session
Setting fill and outline of multiple letters in write

Duplicating things and copy pasting things

editor: should always render selected segment on top

register should close an existing window with the same name

variants of letters

Round rotation

zooming in editor

If things are bigger than normal size -> Also slot this size. Not shrink to include

Bugs:
When pressing new in write, there is an error about not being able to delete an item in the treeview. Part of the code stops working after that.

Open windows don't close when loading a new letter, they can't be closed afterwards

There is sometimes a mismatch between relative position and global position
I FOUND IT! WHEN DRAGGING, ONE OF THE TWO ISN'T UPDATED. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS FIXES ALL CASES THOUGH.

The group button only works when having saved (why?)

Deleting a group doesn't set saved to false

Changing width doesn't set save to false

saving in write doesn't put save to true

Something added itself as a child and parent

automatic deselection in editor not when connectors (or bezier curves?)

Resize doesn't work when coordinate of node is zero

Deleting sometimes leaves inspector open (drag stills works and changes coordinates)

Renaming groups makes them uppercase

Sorting in write didn't work -> Entire open window behaves weird

Mirroring doesn't flip bezier anchors

Open preview shouldn't make grid bigger

When saving writing -> When clicking on a name and changing it, it takes the selected instead of the changed text

Can't scroll in hierarchy write

Can't change multipile things in inspector at the same time.
