Different modes:

To-Do:

    - Saving these settings per session
Setting fill and outline of multiple letters in write

Duplicating things and copy pasting things

editor: should always render selected segment on top

register should close an existing window with the same name

variants of letters

Round rotation

zooming in editor

If things are bigger than normal size -> Also slot this size. Not shrink to include


_______________________________________Things I'll fix for now:


_______________________________________Bugs:


Something added itself as a child and parent

automatic deselection in editor not when connectors (or bezier curves?)

Resize doesn't work when coordinate of node is zero

Deleting sometimes leaves inspector open (drag stills works and changes coordinates)

Sorting in write didn't work -> Entire open window behaves weird

Mirroring doesn't flip bezier anchors

Can't scroll in hierarchy write

Can't change multipile things in inspector at the same time.
